I am a second year doctoral student at Texas A&M University in the Valeris-Chacin Lab. I hold a Bachelor of Science (B.S.) in Wildlife Biology from West Texas A&M University. I began my graduate school journey pursuing my Master of Science with [Dr. Valeris-Chacin](https://www.veroresearch.org/people/valeris/), ultimately transitioning completely into a PhD position after a year and a half in the program. My research focuses on how we can use sequencing technology for enriched detection of etiological important bacteria in food systems. My research goal is to uncover the underlying cause of variation in bovine respiratory disease (BRD) cases within feedlot cattle.

You can learn more about [Bovine Respiratory Disease (BRD)](https://vetmed.tamu.edu/news/pet-talk/bovine-respiratory-disease/) from this TAMU VMBS news article featuring [Dr. Matthew Scott](https://www.veroresearch.org/people/scott/).

Valeris-Chacin Lab
======
The Valeris-Chacin lab uses genomic data to study the causes of bacterial diseases in livestock animals and across complex food systems. Dr. Valeris-Chacin is a Assistant Professor at Texas A&M University in the College of Veterinary Medicine and Biomedical Sciences in the Department of Pathobiology. He was recently awarded a USDA Grant to study the molecular epidemiology of *Mycoplasma bovis* in Bovine Respiratory Disease (BDR) from feedlot cattle.
